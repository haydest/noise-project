# PROJECT 1: MULTI-USER NOISE MANIPULATOR

Want to play with sound? Want to play with friends? Visit our multi-user [Noise Manipulator](https://haydest.github.io/noise-project/)!  We set out to create a web app that allows users to manipulate an oscillator and listen to other users do the same. We succeeded in using Firebase to store and read live cursor-position data, which, when manipulated, alters the frequency and gain (volume) of the audio wave that is created using the WebAudio API. This API uses the user's internal speakers (or other audio output) to produce sounds according to the parameters captured by the mouse position data.

## Getting Started

To use the noise manipulator, press the green play button, then use your mouse to click and drag in the oscillator field to manipulate the noise! If anyone else is using the noise manipulator, additional buttons will appear next to yours. Click on these to start hearing what other users are playing!
